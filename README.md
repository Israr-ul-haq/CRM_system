   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Multi-Branch Architecture

The system now supports multiple branches under a single owner:

### Owner Level
- **Owner Dashboard** (`/owner`): Lists all branches with key metrics
- **Owner Stats** (`/owner/stats`): Aggregated data and charts
- **Branch Management**: Create, edit, and delete branches

### Branch Level
- **Branch Detail** (`/owner/branch/[id]`): Individual branch dashboard
- **Branch Edit** (`/owner/branch/[id]/edit`): Modify branch information
- **Branch Create** (`/owner/branch/create`): Add new branches

### Navigation
- Owner pages are accessible from the main sidebar
- Each branch has its own detailed view
- Seamless navigation between owner and branch levels

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 18, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Shadcn/ui components
- **Icons**: Tabler Icons
- **Charts**: Recharts
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (planned)
- **ORM**: TypeORM (planned)
